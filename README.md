"ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Satish Sharma, a software developer with 10 years of coding experience. During this time, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, from web applications to mobile apps and desktop software.

My passion for coding started at a young age, and I've been hooked ever since. Over the years, I've honed my skills in languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript, and have also dabbled in newer technologies like blockchain and machine learning.

In my current role, I work as a full-stack developer, building and maintaining complex web applications. I love the challenge of finding elegant solutions to tough problems and am constantly learning new techniques and technologies to improve my craft.

When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, playing video games, or reading up on the latest tech trends. Feel free to connect with me and let's chat about all things software development!"
